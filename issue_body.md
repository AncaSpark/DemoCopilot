**Describe the current UI element or behavior**
The application currently has a top navigation band that only contains a single "About" link pointing to the ASP.NET Core documentation. This element takes up vertical space without providing essential functionality for our Tax Calculator application.

The top band is implemented in `TaxCalculator.Web\Components\Layout\MainLayout.razor`:
```razor
<div class="top-row px-4">
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/" target="_blank">About</a>
</div>
```

There are also related CSS styles in `TaxCalculator.Web\Components\Layout\MainLayout.razor.css`.

**Describe the improvement you'd like**
1. Remove the top navigation band with the "About" link from the `MainLayout.razor` file
2. Update any related CSS to ensure the layout remains consistent after removal
3. Consider any responsive design implications

**Why is this improvement needed?**
- Cleaner UI with more vertical space for content
- Reduced visual clutter
- Focus on Tax Calculator application-specific content rather than framework documentation

**Additional context**
Priority: Medium
